# Global Plastic Waste Analysis 

**Country plastic waste production and environmental risk patterns (2023)**

## Overview

This project explores the trends, disparities, and environmental impacts of **global plastic waste** based on a dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajwaldongre/global-plastic-waste-2023-a-country-wise-analysis?resource=download). The analysis covers 165 countries and dives into:

- Total plastic waste generation (in million metric tons)
- Primary waste sources
- National recycling rates
- Per capita plastic waste production
- Coastal waste mismanagement and environmental risk zones

A key focus is understanding **regional differences in waste management** and identifying which countries contribute most significantly to global plastic pollution and why.
