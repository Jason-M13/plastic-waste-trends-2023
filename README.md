# Global Plastic Waste Analysis 

**Country plastic waste production and environmental risk patterns (2023)**

## Overview

This project explores the trends, disparities, and environmental impacts of **global plastic waste** based on a dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajwaldongre/global-plastic-waste-2023-a-country-wise-analysis?resource=download). The analysis covers 165 countries and provides an introspective on:

- Total plastic waste generation (in million metric tons)
- Primary waste sources
- National recycling rates
- Per capita plastic waste production
- Coastal waste mismanagement and environmental risk zones

A key focus is understanding **regional differences in waste management** and identifying which countries contribute most significantly to global plastic pollution and why.

##  Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle: Global Plastic Waste 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajwaldongre/global-plastic-waste-2023-a-country-wise-analysis?resource=download)
- **Features Include**:
  - Country-level plastic waste data (2023)
  - Waste types by source (e.g., packaging, textiles, consumer goods)
  - Recycling statistics
  - Coastal waste mismanagement metrics

---

## Main Questions Explored 

- Which countries generate the most plastic waste and what are the causes?
- How do recycling rates vary across countries and regions?
- What are the potential environmental consequences of mismanaged coastal plastic waste?
